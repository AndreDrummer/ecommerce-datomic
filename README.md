Datomic studies with Clojure

## Usage

To start, you need to install datomic in your machine. You can download it from [here](https://docs.datomic.com/setup/pro-setup.html#get-datomic).
After that, you need to unzip the downloaded file and move the file
`<datomic-VERSION>/samples/dev-transactor-template.properties` to the root of `<datomic-VERSION>`.

In terminal, go to the directory and run the following command:

`bin/transactor config/dev-transactor-template.properties`. The ouptut should be something like this:

; Launching with Java options -server -Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50

; System started

After that, open this project on InteliJ IDEA and start the REPL.
```bash
